running the app will open the "My Package Deliveries Tracker" Window.

Displayed in the center will be a list of packages or, if empty, a message saying "no packages to show"
this can be toggles between 3 states:
1. All, which displays all packages
2. Overdue, which displays packages that are undelivered and past their delivery date
3. Upcoming, which displays packages that are undelivered but are not past their delivery date

each package will have a "delivered" checkbox--this will toggle whether the package is delivered or not
each package will have a remove button--this will remove the package from the list

Clicking "Add New Package" will open the Add Package Window.
All text and date fields will need to be filled out in order to proceed. Every numerical field will default to 0.
Clicking Cancel will take the user back to the main window without adding the Package.

exiting the main window normally will save the packages and package states to JSON. Opening the window will
automatically check for the JSON file, and load it if it exists.
